# Module One Content Knowledge Self-Assessment

In order to teach mod 1, you need to feel confident that you know the content. This is a self-check so that you can feel confident in what you know, or find out what you need to focus on. It starts with taking the code challenge that students take for mod 1, which also serves to familiarize you with the cumulative learning goal for students.

## Mod 1 Code Challenge

* Use the assignments feature in learn to deploy a version of the mod 1 code challenge for yourself.
* Take up to an hour to complete assessment according to the description.
* Submit the assignment via the assignments feature
* View your submission and grade it according to the rubric
* After grading it, have another instructor _grade your grading_.
  * This should be an instructor with familiarity with grading this code challenge.
  * They should give you feedback on your code and feedback about the grading and feedback you wrote for yourself as a student. 

You can find the [code challenges and rubrics for mod 1 in the wiki](https://github.com/flatiron-school/education-team-wiki/tree/master/software-engineering/immersive/modules/module-1#code-challenges).

## Critical Mod 1 Labs

The education team wiki captures a list of [critical mod 1 labs](https://github.com/flatiron-school/education-team-wiki/blob/master/software-engineering/immersive/modules/module-1/labs.md)

You should review these labs to get a sense of the sequencing of the curriculum. If you find that you struggled with the code challenge, you can use these labs as a chance to review the particular concepts that tripped you up. 

After that review, take an alternate assessment to ensure that you feel confident in the content.
